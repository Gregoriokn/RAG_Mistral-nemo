# Ollama + Langchain + RAG Setup

This project demonstrates how to integrate Ollama, Langchain, and RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) models using Mistral-nemo and nomic-embed-text. It shows how to load data from PDFs and URLs, split documents into chunks, store them in a vector database, and perform question answering based on the provided context using Ollamaâ€™s API.
